            <h2>Professional Background</h2>
            <p>
            I graduated from the University of North Texas in 2022 with a degree in Computer Science. Shortly after graduation, I began my career as a consultant with Brooksource, where I worked on-site at American Airlines. After several months in that role, I was brought on full-time by American Airlines as an Associate Developer. In November 2024, I was promoted to Developer, reflecting my continued growth and contributions to the team.

            I work in the Operations division at American Airlines, where our team develops features for applications that support the coordination of aircraft, crew, and airport logistics. I have a strong interest in artificial intelligence and am continually exploring ways to integrate AI solutions into our workflows to enhance efficiency and decision-making. I take a hands-on approach to problem-solving and contribute across the tech stack, working on both front-end and back-end development as needed.
